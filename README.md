# Pydo: tasks in your Terminal

Small to do list application for your Terminal (Work In Progress)

# Quick start guide
Aha, I see you wan't to use `pydo` please note that it is still unstable, but beginning to be somewhat usable (yay!).  
To install it, make `src/main.py` executable, add it to your `$PATH` and there you go!  
#### Quick Tip:
```bash
$ install src/main.py ~/.local/bin/pydo
```
will copy the main.py file to ~/.local/bin and rename it to `pydo`
